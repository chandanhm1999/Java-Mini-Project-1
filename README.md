# Java-Mini-Project-1
Java_Mini_Project Created with Data Structures &amp; Algorithms


* The Main agenda of the project is to showcase the operations and working of different linear data structures.
  A STAND ALONE APPLICATION OF IMPLEMENTING LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES
* This Project Concentrates On the Implementation of Linear Data Structures Like
*.Array 
*.Stack 
*.Queue 
*.Circular Queue 
*.Singly Linked List 
*.doubly Linked List
* Programming Language Used For Implementation : JAVA Concepts 
  Used: Swings,OOPS, Arrays,classes,methods. 
  Tolls Used : Eclipse IDE. 
  Plugin Used: Window Builder (To create JFrames).
* In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. 
  There are two types of data structures. 
   * 1)Linear Data structure 
   * 2)NON Linear Data Structure!
